##  Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <project-folder>

##  Tech Decisions
 
1. Next.js – Chosen for its full-stack capabilities, built-in routing, and SSR/ISR support.

2. Tailwind CSS – For fast, responsive, utility-first styling.

3. Prisma + PostgreSQL – Strong ORM with type-safety and easy schema migrations.

4. Axios – For efficient data fetching.

##  If I Had More Time...
 
1. More loading state.

2. Clean code.

3. Implemented fetching functions in another folders.

4. Implemented timeline and another optional components.
